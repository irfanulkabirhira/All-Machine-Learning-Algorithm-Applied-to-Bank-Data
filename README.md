🏦 Bank Marketing Campaign – ML Model Comparison

🔍 Project Overview

This project applies and compares multiple supervised machine learning algorithms to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit product based on their interaction with a bank's marketing campaign.

🎯 Objective

To build, compare, and evaluate a variety of ML classification models for binary prediction (yes/no) using real-world bank marketing data. Focused on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to determine the best-performing model.
